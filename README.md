A modern, responsive To-Do List web app built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB. Includes user authentication, full CRUD operations, multiple boards, priorities, focus mode, and a future-ready modular design.


Advanced To-Do List is a clean, responsive, and fully functional productivity web application built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS templates, and MongoDB.

This project combines a modern, user-friendly HTML & CSS front-end with a robust back-end that supports:

âœ… User registration and secure login using Passport.js and bcrypt  
âœ… Full CRUD operations for tasks (create, view, edit, delete)  
âœ… Multiple boards (Personal, Work, Planner, Habits)  
âœ… Task priorities, due dates, flags, and focus mode  
âœ… Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox  
âœ… Inline SVG icons, modern fonts, and hover animations  
âœ… Well-structured code ready for future expansion and real deployment

This project is perfect as a base for building a complete productivity or habit-tracking tool. You can extend it with real-time features, mobile support, or integrate it with external calendar APIs.
